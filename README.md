**Diskover** is an open-source tool designed for OSINT purposes. It empowers users to conduct reconnaissance activities on a target domain, providing insights such as subdomain enumeration, DNS lookup, code snippets related to the domain, IP history, and more. Equips you with the means to gather valuable information about a target domain efficiently.

## Features

### Subdomain Enumeration
Discover subdomains associated with the target domain, enabling comprehensive reconnaissance.

### DNS Lookup
Perform DNS lookups for the target domain, retrieving essential information like IP addresses, mail servers, and more.

### Code Snippets
Retrieve code snippets related to the target domain.

### IP History
Access the IP history of the target domain, uncovering its past associations and potential changes over time.

### And More...
Continues to evolve with additional features and enhancements.

> It's important to note that you can activate or deactivate the analysis of code snippets, discovered URLs, and subdomains. However, enabling these capabilities for certain domains may significantly increase the time required for analysis.

## Installation
